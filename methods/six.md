What does the following error message tell you?

ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
  from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
  from (irb):4
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/i

  The method 'calculate_product' takes 2 arguments, but the code is trying to pass 1 argument. This could be addressed by defining the method with default arguments.
